Packr

Packr is an organizational tool to assist an organizer of a trip in giving a list of essential items needed to the trip goers. Organizers
will be able to build custom lists of items which will become individual to the trip goers so they can check items off as they aquire them,
add extra items they may need for themselves, and view the list in their entirety.

Organizers can load gear lists to their given trips
Trip goers can add their own custom items, delete items they create, and check items off of their given list as complete
